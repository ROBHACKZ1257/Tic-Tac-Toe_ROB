### This game is a two player game. Of course I could add AI but that would ruin the fun and would make the game boring, because AI can already anticipate many moves with algorithms that AI can encounter. ANYWAY I WILL EXPLAIN THE INSTRUCTIONS of the game. How tic tac toe works is you have a box that contains 3x3 rows and cells and in each cell inside of the box you can either click X or O, so typically you have two players and one of them is X's and the other O's and whatever team you want to play with is ultimately up to you. To win the game you must match all 3 of the same symbols kind of like connect 4 unless you're living under a rock and it can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, BUT THEY MUST MATCH ALL 3 in order to win. If in the event that there are not many spots to fill in then the game will be officially tied *phew* thank goodness I don't have to take the L and the game will restart until they have 3 matching symbols in the box.

### The reason I choose this project is because I have an individual project which we created a game for a class and I came with this idea over the weekend so the more simple the game is the better off you are in succeeding in the class.
